<p class="lead"><strong>contagiously enthusiastic</strong> builds explosively passionate distributed technical communities around a common practice, and we can teach you how to do the same.</p>

<h2>services</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>community health assessment</strong> - what's your community <em>really</em> doing, and how much better could it be? Discover what your recruiting and leadership development pathways look like to new and experienced contributors and identify hidden imbalances that bottleneck you from further growth.
</li>
<li><strong>team leader coaching</strong> for domain experts who want to build a community of practitioners, apprentices, and/or volunteers to help with their work. We'll help you build your own small army.</li>
<li><strong>open sourcing facilitation</strong> for teams with software products they're ready to unleash the world upon. Slapping an open license on something is <em>not</em> magic fairy dust; we'll work with you in the months and weeks leading up to launch so that when you release it, they <em>will</em> come.
</li>
<li><strong>talks, seminars, workshops, and classes</strong> for industry, enthusiast, and academic groups on open source practices, processes, culture, and how to get involved. Custom curriculum and talk design available.</li>
</ul>

<h2>rates</h2>

<p>Here's how pricing works:</p>
<ol>
<li>We work with you to scope out the project.</li>
<li>We tell you how many hours of our time we think it's going to take.</li>
<li>We agree upon an hourly rate. Multiply that by the number of hours it'll take and you'll have the final quote of what our blood, sweat, and tears will cost you. Even if it takes us longer than our original estimate, you'll never get charged more than this amount for our time.</li>
<li>We deliver.</li>
<li>You smile.</li>
</ol>

<p>On average, our rate is about $80 per hour (plus expenses, which are separate). The final quote depends on the project, its duration, the type of work involved, and timing. So if your project requires regular 3am meetings with overseas contributors, it's going to cost a little more to make up for the increased consumption of strong cups of tea. If it involves teaching Girl Scouts about robots at the amusement park over the weekend, we're <em>pretty</em> likely to give you a discount, because that's <em>awesome</em>.</p>

<p>We love nonprofit, volunteer, and educational institutions. Tell us why you believe in what you do, and we'll do our best to make it possible for you to work with us.</p>
